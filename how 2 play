deck possibilities:
archer skarmy minions giant witch fireball zap bomber
if the cards are in your deck, this is the priority and how you should use them:
giant at back (if full elixir) first option
witch behind giant or witch on defense 
fireball and zap when needed
split archers at back
in the event of the worst hand (skarmy minions bomber and a spell or 2 of these cards and a spell) use bomber at the back
or if it is just (skarmy and minions with 2 spells) either if you have not made full elixir yet use the fireballs in good situations or the troops when needed
otherwise split the minions at the back
if you have witch skarmy and 2 spells place witch at the back
make the starting moves on full elixir unless required to defend
if the opponent has a hog or something you need a certain card for, make sure you DONT use that card. otherwise you wont have it when you need it.
eg skarmy on hog or zap on goblin gang
